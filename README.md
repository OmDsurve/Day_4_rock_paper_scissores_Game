# Day_4_rock_paper_scissores_Game
This Python script is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game. The player picks Rock (0), Paper (1), or Scissors (2), and the computer randomly selects one too. Both choices are displayed using ASCII art. The game then determines the winner: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beat Paper, and Paper beats Rock. If both choose the same, itâ€™s a draw.
