# Day_4_rock_paper_scissores_Game
Here's a description of your Rock, Paper, Scissors game in Python:

---

This Python script is a simple implementation of the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors." The game works as follows:

1.User Input:** The player is prompted to choose between Rock (0), Paper (1), or Scissors (2).
2.Computer Choice:** The computer randomly selects one of the three options.
3.Display Choices:** The script displays both the user's and the computer's choices using ASCII art.
4.Determine the Winner:** The game compares the user's choice with the computer's choice:
   - Rock beats Scissors.
   - Scissors beat Paper.
   - Paper beats Rock.
   - If both choose the same, it's a draw.
5.Invalid Input:** If the user inputs a number outside 0, 1, or 2, the game notifies the user of an invalid move.

This project is a great way to practice conditional statements, list indexing, and user interaction in Python. The addition of ASCII art makes the game more engaging and visually appealing!.
